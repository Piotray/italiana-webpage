## Italiana Project

## Description
This project is a website for an Italian restaurant that I built to demonstrate my skills in React JS. The website showcases various effects and techniques to highlight my abilities in web development. From designing the components to implementing interactive features, this project represents a complete workflow from start to finish, from idea to result. It demonstrates my proficiency not only in developing individual elements and components but also in delivering a cohesive and complex web project.
